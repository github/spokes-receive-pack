# Getting support

This project is a small component of a much larger system.
As we aren't accepting community contributions and don't expect it to be very useful outside a running GitHub instance, we therefore offer no direct support.
If you're having trouble with GitHub.com, a GitHub Enterprise Server, or other GitHub product, please visit https://support.github.com/ to learn about your support options.
