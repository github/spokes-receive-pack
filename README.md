# spokes-receive-pack

`spokes-receive-pack` is a replacement for `git-receive-pack`, used on the server side of a `git push`. `git-receive-pack` does more than we need it to, `spokes-receive-pack` implements the bits of it that we still need.

We don't expect this to be generally useful outside of GitHub's service backend, and we don't plan to accept contributions from outside GitHub.
